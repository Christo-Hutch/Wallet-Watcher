# Wallet-Watcher
A Java app used to track your personal income, expenses, savings and investments. Whilst the app has been given the title "Wallet Watcher", it aims to track a wide range of varying account types as well as integrate as many monetary asset management tools into a single place; unlike most other money management apps.

Wallet Watcher is being created with versatility and robustness in mind. That is why it has adopted a hexagonial architecture, which enables future changes to the app (GUI, new features or portability) to be executed with ease. At first the app will use a terminal-base UI system, hopefully developing into a more user-friendly GUI that is far more appealing to the eye. Wallet Watcher also aims to follow the industry standards closely in order for additional programmers to understand the code easily if ever needed.
